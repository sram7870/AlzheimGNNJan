        "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasingly characterized as a disorder of large-scale brain network disintegration rather than isolated regional dysfunction. Neuroimaging work highlights early disruption of functional connectivity (particularly within hub-dominated systems such as the Default Mode Network), followed by compensatory reorganization and progressive network collapse. Standard ML approaches that use static or Euclidean representations can miss the temporally-evolving network-driven patterns that are clinically meaningful. This project reframes AD modeling as a graph learning problem: nodes are brain regions whose features capture neurophysiological descriptors (ALFF, ReHo proxies, rolling activation statistics), while edges encode dynamic functional connectivity. To capture deteriorating connectivity and smooth longitudinal changes, we model temporal evolution via continuous-time graph neural ODEs (Neural ODE GNNs). Neural ODEs naturally accommodate irregular longitudinal sampling and missing visits by integrating graph-parameterized instantaneous dynamics over arbitrary time grids, enabling smooth subject-level latent trajectories with variable inter-scan intervals common in longitudinal neuroimaging. For interpretability we provide attention-based edge weighting and node-level attributions (PX node-feature masks, PA edge attention, gradient/IG-based saliency) so clinicians and researchers can identify disease-relevant ROIs and subnetworks and inspect subject-level trajectories.\n",
